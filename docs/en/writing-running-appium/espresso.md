# Espresso

To run the appium espresso driver, set the `automationName` in desired capabilities to 'espresso'. Espresso driver is used the same way that UIAutomator is used. (Warning: Appium Espresso driver is currently in early beta and meant only for experimental usage. Its API is not yet complete or guaranteed to work. Please report bugs to the Appium team on GitHub).
